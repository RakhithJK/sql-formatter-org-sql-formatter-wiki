[SQL standard][] defines the following syntax for ordering:

    ORDER BY {expr [ASC | DESC] [NULLS FIRST | NULLS LAST]} ["," ...]

This exact syntax is supported by:

- [BigQuery][]
- [N1QL][]
- [Redshift][]
- [Snowflake][]
- [Trino][]

Other dialects have some variations:

[DB2][]:

    ORDER BY INPUT SEQUENCE

    ORDER BY sort_specification [ {"," sort_specification}... ]

    sort_specification:
        ORDER OF table_name
      | expr [ASC | DESC] [NULLS FIRST | NULLS LAST]

[Hive][] and [Spark][] provide ORDER BY, SORT BY, CLUSTER BY, DISTRIBUTE BY:

    ORDER BY {column [ASC | DESC] [NULLS FIRST | NULLS LAST]} ["," ...]

    SORT BY  {column [ASC | DESC] [NULLS FIRST | NULLS LAST]} ["," ...]

    CLUSTER BY column [ {"," column}... ]

    DISTRIBUTE BY column [ {"," column}... ]

[MariaDB][]:

    ORDER BY {expr [ASC | DESC]} ["," ...]

[MySQL][]:

    ORDER BY {expr [ASC | DESC]} ["," ...] [WITH ROLLUP]

[PL/SQL][]:

    ORDER [SIBLINGS] BY {expr [ASC | DESC] [NULLS FIRST | NULLS LAST]} ["," ...]

[PostgreSQL][]:

    ORDER BY {expr [ASC | DESC | USING operator] [NULLS FIRST | NULLS LAST]} ["," ...]

[SingleStoreDB][]:

    ORDER BY {expr [ASC | DESC]} ["," ...]

[SQLite][]:

    ORDER BY {expr [COLLATE collation] [ASC | DESC] [NULLS FIRST | NULLS LAST]} ["," ...]

[Transact-SQL][]:

    ORDER BY {expr [COLLATE collation] [ASC | DESC]} ["," ...]
