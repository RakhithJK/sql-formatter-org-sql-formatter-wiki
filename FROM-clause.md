Here's a simplified syntax of FROM clause from [SQL standard][]:

    FROM table_reference ["," ...]

    table_reference:
      table_factor | joined_table

    joined_table:
        table_reference CROSS JOIN table_reference [join_specification]
      | table_reference [join_type] JOIN table_reference [join_specification]
      | table_reference NATURAL [join_type] JOIN table_reference

    join_type:
        INNER
      | {LEFT | RIGHT | FULL} [OUTER]

    join_specification:
        ON expr
      | USING "(" identifier ["," ...] ")"

Dialects mainly differ in what sort of joins they support:

[BigQuery][]:

Does not support `NATURAL JOIN`.

[DB2][]:

Does not support `NATURAL JOIN` and `USING` specification.

[Hive][]:

Does not support `NATURAL JOIN` and `USING` specification.

Additionally supports `LEFT SEMI JOIN`.

[MariaDB][]:

Does not support `FULL` keyword in joins (like `FULL OUTER JOIN` or `NATURAL FULL JOIN`).

Does not support `NATURAL INNER JOIN`.

Additionally supports `STRAIGHT_JOIN`.

[MySQL][]:

Does not support `FULL` keyword in joins (like `FULL OUTER JOIN` or `NATURAL FULL JOIN`).

Additionally supports `STRAIGHT_JOIN`.

[N1QL][]:

Does not support `FULL` keyword in joins.

Does not support `NATURAL JOIN` and `CROSS JOIN`.

Does not support `USING` specification, instead supports:

    join_specification:
        ON expr
      | ON [PRIMARY] KEY expr [FOR identifier]

[PL/SQL][]:

Support the full standard plus apply-joins:

- `CROSS APPLY`
- `OUTER APPLY`

[PostgreSQL][]:

Supports the full standard.

[Redshift][]:

Supports the full standard.

[Spark][]:

Supports the full standard plus:

- `[LEFT] SEMI JOIN`
- `[LEFT] ANTI JOIN`

And `NATURAL ... JOIN` versions of these.

[SQLite][]:

Supports the full standard.

[Transact-SQL][]:

Does not support `NATURAL JOIN` and `USING` specification.

Additionally supports apply-joins:

- `CROSS APPLY`
- `OUTER APPLY`

[Trino][]:

Supports the full standard.
