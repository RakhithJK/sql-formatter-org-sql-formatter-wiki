[SQL standard][] defines the following syntax for GROUP BY clause:

    GROUP BY [ALL | DISTINCT] expr ["," ...]

There's a considerable variation is dialects:

[BigQuery][]:

    GROUP BY { expr ["," ...] | ROLLUP { expr ["," ...] } }

[DB2][]:

    GROUP BY { expr | GROUPING SETS grouping_sets | super_groups } ["," ...]

    grouping_sets:
      "(" { expr | super_groups | grouping_sets } ["," ...] ")"

    super_groups:
      [ROLLUP | CUBE] "(" expr ["," ...] ")"

[Hive][]:

    GROUP BY expr ["," ...] [GROUPING SETS "(" expr ["," ...] ")"] [WITH ROLLUP | WITH CUBE]

[MariaDB][]:

    GROUP BY expr [ASC | DESC] ["," ...] [WITH ROLLUP]

[MySQL][]:

    GROUP BY expr ["," ...] [WITH ROLLUP]

[N1QL][] additionally supports LETTING clause (which can follow or replace GROUP BY):

    GROUP BY expr ["," ...]

    LETTING alias "=" expr ["," ...]

[PL/SQL][]:

    GROUP BY {expr | rollup_cube | grouping | "()"} ["," ...]

    rollup_cube:
      [ROLLUP | CUBE] "(" expr ["," ...] ")"

    grouping_sets:
      GROUPING SETS "(" {rollup_cube | expr} ["," ...] ")"

[PostgreSQL][]:

    GROUP BY [ ALL | DISTINCT ] expr ["," ...]

[Redshift][]:

    GROUP BY expr ["," ...]

[Spark][]:

    GROUP BY expr ["," ...] [WITH ROLLUP | WITH CUBE]

    GROUP BY {expr | {ROLLUP | CUBE | GROUPING SETS} "(" expr ["," ...] ")"} ["," ...]

[SQLite][]:

    GROUP BY expr ["," ...]

[Transact-SQL][]:

    GROUP BY {expr | {ROLLUP group_expr | CUBE group_expr | GROUPING SETS grouping_set | "()" } ["," ...]

    GROUP BY [ALL] expr ["," ...] [WITH CUBE | WITH ROLLUP]

    GROUP BY expr [WITH "(" DISTRIBUTED_AGG ")"] ["," ...]

    group_expr:
        expr
      | "(" expr ["," ...] ")"

    grouping_set:
        group_expr
      | ROLLUP "(" group_expr ["," ...] ")"
      | CUBE "(" group_expr ["," ...] ")"

[Trino][]:

    GROUP BY [ALL | DISTINCT] {grp_set | rollup_cube | grouping_sets} ["," ...]

    rollup_cube:
      [ROLLUP | CUBE] "(" expr ["," ...] ")"

    grouping_sets:
      GROUPING SETS "(" grp_set ["," ...] ")"

    grp_set:
        expr
      | "(" expr ["," ...] ")"
