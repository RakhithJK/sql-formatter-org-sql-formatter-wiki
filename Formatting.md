## Tools

Other tools that perform SQL formatting.

- [sqlparse](https://sqlformat.org/) Python library and online formatter.\
  (This one is really quite bad. The style is a bit like our tabularLeft, but with variable indentation.
  The formatting of CREATE TABLE is exceptionally bad.)
- [pgFormatter](https://sqlformat.darold.net/) Perl library an online formatter for PostgreSQL.
  This looks pretty nice. Has several useful options. Handles comments. Though it doesn't do anything with long lines and the indentation is a bit of a mixed bag. 
- [Instant SQL formatter](https://www.dpriver.com/pp/sqlformat.htm) online tool and VS plugin.\
  Uses tabularLeft & tabularRight styles, but with 7 instead of 10 spaces.
- [Freeformatter.com](https://www.freeformatter.com/sql-formatter.html) a site with online formatters for many languages.\
  Uses our standard style.
- [Code Beautify](https://codebeautify.org/sqlformatter) another site with multiple formatters.\
  Uses our standard style.
- [SQL Complete](https://www.devart.com/dbforge/sql/sqlcomplete/) a proprietary tool from Devart. [Online version](https://sql-format.com/)\
  By default uses a compact version of our standard style, but has huge amount of configuration options.
- [SQL Formatter](https://www.apexsql.com/sql-tools-refactor.aspx) a proprietary tool from ApexSQL.
- [SQLinForm](https://www.sqlinform.com/) a proprietary tool (also free versions available)
- [SQL Pretty Printer](https://www.dpriver.com/) a proprietary tool.
- [SQL Fluff](https://github.com/sqlfluff/sqlfluff) A linter and formatter for SQL, written in Python. [Online version.](https://online.sqlfluff.com/)
- [SQL Prompt](https://www.red-gate.com/website/sql-formatter) A proprietary tool, has an online demo of the formatter.\
  Supports multiple distinct styles of formatting.

Here's some example SQL to test out various formatters:

```sql
SELECT
  supplier_name, city -- inline comment
  ,(select count(*) from people where supplier_id = s.id) as sup_count
FROM suppliers s left join addresses a on s.address_id=a.id
WHERE s.value>500 and a.city = 'New York'
ORDER BY supplier_name asc,city desc;

/* another comment in here */
INSERT INTO articles
(title, author, submission_date)
VALUES ('Learn SQL', 'John Doe', now());

UPDATE articles
SET author = 'Peter', submission_date = '2022-01-01'
WHERE title like '%by Peter';

CREATE TABLE articles (
  id int not null auto_increment,
  title varchar(100) not null,
  author varchar(40) not null,
  submission_date date,
  primary key ( id )
);
```
