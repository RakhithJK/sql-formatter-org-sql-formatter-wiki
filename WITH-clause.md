[SQL standard][] defines the following syntax for WITH clause:

    WITH [RECURSIVE] common_table_expression ["," ...]

    common_table_expression:
      identifier ["(" column_name_list ")"] AS "(" query_expression ")"
        [search_clause]
        [cycle_clause]

    search_clause:
      SEARCH {DEPTH | BREATH} FIRST BY column_name_list SET identifier

    cycle_clause:
      CYCLE column_name_list
        SET identifier TO expr
        DEFAULT expr USING identifier

    column_name_list:
      identifier ["," ...]

No dialect fully supports the standard:

[BigQuery][]:

    WITH [RECURSIVE] common_table_expression ["," ...]

    common_table_expression:
      identifier AS "(" query_expression ")"

[DB2][]:

    WITH common_table_expression ["," ...]

    common_table_expression:
      identifier ["(" column_name_list ")"] AS "(" query_expression ")"

[Hive][]:

    WITH common_table_expression ["," ...]

    common_table_expression:
      identifier AS "(" query_expression ")"

[MariaDB][] supports just a single `common_table_expression`:

    WITH [RECURSIVE] common_table_expression

    common_table_expression:
      identifier ["(" column_name_list ")"] AS "(" query_expression ")"
      [CYCLE column_name_list RESTRICT]

[MySQL][]:

    WITH [RECURSIVE] common_table_expression ["," ...]

    common_table_expression:
      identifier ["(" column_name_list ")"] AS "(" query_expression ")"

[N1QL][]:

    WITH common_table_expression ["," ...]

    common_table_expression:
      identifier AS "(" query_expression ")"

[PL/SQL][]:

    WITH [plsql_declarations] [common_table_expression ["," ...]]

    plsql_declarations:
      function_declaration | procedure_declaration

    common_table_expression:
      identifier ["(" column_name_list ")"] AS "(" query_expression ")"
      [search_clause]
      [cycle_clause]

    search_clause:
      SEARCH {DEPTH | BREATH} FIRST BY {column_alias ["," ...]} SET identifier

    column_alias:
      identifier [ASC | DESC] [NULLS FIRST | NULLS LAST]

    cycle_clause:
      CYCLE column_name_list
        SET identifier TO expr
        DEFAULT expr

[PostgreSQL][]:

    WITH [RECURSIVE] common_table_expression ["," ...]

    common_table_expression:
      identifier ["(" column_name_list ")"] AS [[NOT] MATERIALIZED] "(" query_expression ")"
        [search_clause]
        [cycle_clause]

    search_clause:
      SEARCH {DEPTH | BREATH} FIRST BY column_name_list SET identifier

    cycle_clause:
      CYCLE column_name_list SET identifier USING identifier

[Redshift][]:

    WITH [RECURSIVE] common_table_expression ["," ...]

    common_table_expression:
      identifier ["(" column_name_list ")"] AS "(" query_expression ")"

[SingleStoreDB][]:

    WITH common_table_expression ["," ...]

    common_table_expression:
      identifier ["(" column_name_list ")"] AS "(" query_expression ")"

[Snowflake][]:

    WITH [RECURSIVE] common_table_expression ["," ...]

    common_table_expression:
      identifier ["(" column_name_list ")"] AS "(" query_expression ")"


[Spark][]:

    WITH common_table_expression ["," ...]

    common_table_expression:
      identifier ["(" column_name_list ")"] AS "(" query_expression ")"

[SQLite][]:

    WITH [RECURSIVE] common_table_expression ["," ...]

    common_table_expression:
      identifier ["(" column_name_list ")"] AS [[NOT] MATERIALIZED] "(" query_expression ")"

[Transact-SQL][]:

    WITH common_table_expression ["," ...]

    common_table_expression:
      identifier ["(" column_name_list ")"] AS "(" query_expression ")"

[Trino][]:

    WITH [RECURSIVE] common_table_expression ["," ...]

    common_table_expression:
      identifier ["(" column_name_list ")"] AS "(" query_expression ")"
